This tutorial is adapted from Deanna Fernando's asimov tutorial to recreate the analysis performed for Efficient reanalysis of events from GWTC-3 with RIFT and asimov [(arXiv:2412.02999)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02999). The original tutorial (and python scripts) can be found [here](https://git.ligo.org/deanna.fernando/settings/-/tree/main?ref_type=heads). The tutorial was modified here to be a simpler introduction to asimov, as opposed to duplicating the analysis done for the paper.
